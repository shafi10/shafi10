### About Me
I am a full stack web developer, I have built several server-side web application logic and integration of the work front-end web developers do. I can work with the Node Js framework like Express Js. I can usually create RESTful APIs using Node Js. I use the MongoDB database for backend development. Now I am learning to React-Redux for frontend development, and I am looking for a position where I can progress and challenge my skills.
